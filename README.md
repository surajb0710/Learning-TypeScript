Learning TypeScript
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning TypeScript, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other powerful features to the language. It serves as a personal learning resource, containing various examples, projects, and notes as I explore and master TypeScript.

Contents

- Basic Syntax and Types: Variables, functions, and type annotations.
- Advanced Types: Interfaces, type aliases, unions, intersections, and generics.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, inheritance, and access modifiers.
- Asynchronous Programming: Working with Promises and async/await in TypeScript.
- Modules and Namespaces: Importing and exporting TypeScript modules.
- Error Handling and Debugging: Type-safe error management.
- Tooling and Configuration: Setting up TypeScript with tsconfig.json, linting, and build tools.

Goals

- Gain a deeper understanding of TypeScript and its practical applications.
- Improve code quality, maintainability, and scalability in TypeScript-based projects.
- Build a strong foundation for using TypeScript in modern web development frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute if you have suggestions!
